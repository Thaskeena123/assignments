    <h3>front end</h3>
    <p> Generally speaking, the front end is the user-facing part of a website. It's what you see when you type in something like "codecademy.com." But, of course, there's more to it than that.As Front-End Web Developer Pat DePuydt explains in the video above, the front end is the part of the website a user or customer interacts with. A lot goes into making the front end work, including database architecture, frameworks, scaling solutions, and ,<br> It includes:<br>

        Styles: This includes the buttons, layouts, inputs, text, images, and more. It's the overall look of the website. <br>
        Accessibility: Accessibility features like text-to-speech, voice recognition, simple user flows, and more, make websites easier to use and provide a better user experience. <br>
        Speed: Most people won't wait for a website to load. The faster a website works, the better. <br></p>
        <h3>Back end</h3>
        <p>The back end is a combination of servers and databases. Servers control how users access files. Databases are organized and structured collections of data. <br>

            Here's an example: When you log into a website and enter your username or email and password. This information is sent to the server-side software which validates the structure of your email and password. If everything looks good, it checks the data with the database to ensure someone with that username and password exists. If it does, the database will log you in and sends information back to you in the form of your user page.</p>

        <code>
            (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2;
            
            (a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3;
