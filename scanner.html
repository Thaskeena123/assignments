    <h1>Scanner</h1>
    <p>A scanner is a device that captures images from photographic prints, posters, magazine pages and similar sources for computer editing and display.

        Scanners work by converting the image on the document into digital information that can be stored on a computer through optical character recognition (OCR).
        
        This process is done by a scanning head, which uses one or more sensors to capture the image as light or electrical charges.
        
        The document scanner moves either the physical document or the scanning head, depending on the type of scanner. Then, the scanner processes the scanned image and produces a digital image that can be stored on a computer.
        
        Scanners usually attach to a computer system and come with scanning software applications that let you resize and otherwise modify a captured image.
        
        If a printer is hooked up to the computer, you could print a second hard copy of the scanned image and store it in digital format.</p>
